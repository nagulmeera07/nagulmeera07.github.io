**This section documents my computational studies and numerical experiments carried out using CFD tools.**

---

### CFD Tools Used
- ANSYS Fluent
- OpenFOAM
- PyFluent

---

### Simulation Categories
- Single-phase internal and external flows
- Multiphase spray modeling
- Discrete Phase Modeling (DPM)
- Validation of experimental data
- Cantera (problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.)

---

### Methodology
1. Geometry creation and simplification
2. Mesh generation and independence study
3. Boundary condition justification
4. Solver and model selection
5. Post-processing and physical interpretation

Each simulation emphasizes **physics, assumptions, and limitations**, not just results.

### Status
Latest simulation results and detailed case studies  
will be published here **soon**.
