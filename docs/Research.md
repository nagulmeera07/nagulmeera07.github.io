**My research work focuses on low-flow, low-pressure atomization systems and their practical applications.**

---

### Major Research Area
## Flow Blurring Injectors ( A Novel Twin fluid low liquid and gas flow rate Injector used in Micro Combustor Applications)

- Sauter Mean Diameter
- Spray cone angle measurement
- Droplet size distribution analysis
- Effect of Gas-to-liquid ratio (ALR)
- Suitability for portable and micro-combustion systems

---

### Experimental Techniques
- Shadowgraphy imaging
- High-speed camera diagnostics
- Image processing for droplet characterization in MATLAB

---

### Numerical Work
- Approximating spray behavior using empirical distributions
- CFD validation of experimental trends
- Study of breakup and dispersion mechanisms

---

### Research Goal
To bridge the gap between **experiments and simulations** for realistic spray modeling at ultra-low flow rates.

### Status
Research, figures, and discussions  
will be added here **as they are finalized**.
