 **I completed my B.Tech and M.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Andhra University and IIT Jodhpur, Respectively. During my final year B.Tech, I joined as a project intern at AMTZ, Vizag and worked on Fused depositional Modelling in Additive Manufacturing Technology. Collaborated with researchers on CFD simulations to modify the hot extrusion nozzle design for improved melting and filament flow. Assisted in developing an FDM mini 3D printer. This work cultivated an interest in product design and Computational Fluid Dynamics.**

**My M.Tech Thesis involved developing the CFD Model for predicting the spray characteristics of Flow blurring injector(application in miniature combustors) and validated with the Experimental results found in house developed experimental test rig.
This Project helped me to gain experience in conducting research.**
