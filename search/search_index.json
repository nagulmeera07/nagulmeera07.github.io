During my final year B.Tech, I joined as a project intern at AMTZ, Vizag and worked on Fused depositional Modelling in Additive Manufacturing Technology. Collaborated with researchers on CFD simulations to modify the hot extrusion nozzle design for improved melting and filament flow. Assisted in developing an FDM mini 3D printer. This work cultivated an interest in product design and Computational Fluid Dynamics. My M.Tech Thesis involved developing the CFD Model for predicting the spray characteristics of Flow blurring injector(application in miniature combustors) and validated with the Experimental results found in house developed experimental test rig. This Project helped me to gain experience in conducting research.</p>"},{"location":"About/#education","title":"Education","text":"Year School Degree 2025 Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur M.Tech in ThermoFuids Engineering 2022 Andhra University, Vizag B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering"},{"location":"About/#academic-interests","title":"Academic Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Fluid mechanics </li> <li>Multiphase and turbulent flows</li> <li>Heat and mass transfer</li> <li>Numerical modeling and CFD</li> <li>Spray dynamics</li> <li>Combustion</li> <li>Aerodynamics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"About/#technical-skills","title":"Technical Skills","text":"<ul> <li>ANSYS Fluent, OpenFoam</li> <li>Python Programming</li> <li>High-speed flow visualization</li> <li>Image-based spray characterization</li> <li>Scientific documentation (LaTeX, Markdown)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Research/","title":"Research","text":"<p>My research work focuses on low-flow, low-pressure atomization systems and their practical applications.</p>"},{"location":"Research/#major-research-area","title":"Major Research Area","text":""},{"location":"Research/#flow-blurring-injectors-a-novel-twin-fluid-low-liquid-and-gas-flow-rate-injector-used-in-micro-combustor-applications","title":"Flow Blurring Injectors ( A Novel Twin fluid low liquid and gas flow rate Injector used in Micro Combustor Applications)","text":"<ul> <li>Sauter Mean Diameter</li> <li>Spray cone angle measurement</li> <li>Droplet size distribution analysis</li> <li>Effect of Gas-to-liquid ratio (ALR)</li> <li>Suitability for portable and micro-combustion systems</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Research/#experimental-techniques","title":"Experimental Techniques","text":"<ul> <li>Shadowgraphy imaging</li> <li>High-speed camera diagnostics</li> <li>Image processing for droplet characterization in MATLAB</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Research/#numerical-work","title":"Numerical Work","text":"<ul> <li>Approximating spray behavior using empirical distributions</li> <li>CFD validation of experimental trends</li> <li>Study of breakup and dispersion mechanisms</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Research/#research-goal","title":"Research Goal","text":"<p>To bridge the gap between experiments and simulations for realistic spray modeling at ultra-low flow rates.</p>"},{"location":"Research/#status","title":"Status","text":"<p>Research, figures, and discussions will be added here as they are finalized.</p> <p>Last updated: Dec 2025</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>If you would like to connect regarding research, simulations, or collaborations:</p> <p>Email</p> <p>Linkedin</p> <p>This website is actively maintained and updated as my work progresses.</p>"},{"location":"simulations/","title":"Simulations","text":"<p>This section documents my computational studies and numerical experiments carried out using CFD tools.</p>"},{"location":"simulations/#cfd-tools-used","title":"CFD Tools Used","text":"<ul> <li>ANSYS Fluent</li> <li>OpenFOAM</li> <li>PyFluent</li> <li>Paraview</li> </ul>"},{"location":"simulations/#simulation-categories","title":"Simulation Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Single-phase internal and external flows</li> <li>Multiphase spray modeling</li> <li>Discrete Phase Modeling (DPM)</li> <li>Validation of experimental data</li> <li>Cantera (problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"simulations/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<ol> <li>Geometry creation and simplification</li> <li>Mesh generation and independence study</li> <li>Boundary condition justification</li> <li>Solver and model selection</li> <li>Post-processing and physical interpretation</li> </ol> <p>Each simulation emphasizes physics, assumptions, and limitations, not just results.</p>"},{"location":"simulations/#status","title":"Status","text":"<p>Latest simulation results and detailed case studies will be published here soon.</p> <p>Last updated: Dec 2025</p>"}]}
